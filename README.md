Step 1: Create a environment.env file

In your project directory, create a file named environment.env
Add your API key in the following format:

API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
ORG_ID=your_organization_id

Replace your_actual_api_key_here with your real Meraki Dashboard API key.


This approach keeps your API keys out of your source code and makes your scripts more secure and portable.
